These days people pay more attention to artists (writers, painters and so on) and give less importance to science and technology. To what extent do you agree or disagree?


I absolutely disagree with the idea that people pay more attention to artists than science and technology these days.

Paying more attention to art does not necessarily mean giving less importance to science and technology. On the contrary, art historically matches science and technology pretty well, if not intrinsically. It is well known that Leonardo da Vinci, the scientist, engineer, and genius of everything, painted the Mona Lisa. This painting is the best known, most visited, most written about, most sung about, and most parodied work of art in human history. Similarly, the endless passion the legendary Steve Jobs put in fusing art and technology is radiant. He continually used the word "taste" in Apple's R&D projects, and all Apple products are strikingly beautiful. The Smithsonian Institution even published an article titled "A tribute to a great artist: Steve Jobs." Moreover, Elon Musk decorated the external walls of Tesla's Gigafactory Berlin with breathtaking giant graffiti from around the world. He also sent Japanese drummer and art collector Yusaku Maezawa into space.

There are many additional facts supporting my point of view. Electric guitar is a perfect resonance of acoustic guitar and electromagnetic technology; Ikea is embracing artists and artificial intelligence; Sony is both a hi-tech manufacturer and a producer of movies, games, and music; paintings and drawings can now be created digitally on computers and tablets; Russian astronaut Alexei Leonov was an art school graduate and drew orbital sunrises in space; and Nicole Kidman once dated Eric Watson, a New Zealand entrepreneur who invested in technology.

In conclusion, I wholly disagree that people pay more attention to artists and give less importance to science and technology these days. For centuries, art has been inspiring science and technology to advance dramatically, and science and technology keep raising art to new and higher levels.
